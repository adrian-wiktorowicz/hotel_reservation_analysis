# Hotel Booking Demand Analysis

## Project Description
This project analyzes hotel booking behaviors using data sourced from Kaggle's "Hotel Booking Demand" dataset. The dataset includes reservations made at city hotels and resort hotels, with insightful attributes.
The dataset is rich in details, allowing for comprehensive analysis. The project focuses on exploring booking behaviors and predicting specific outcomes based on historical data.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:
- `hotel_booking_analysis.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook containing data analysis, modeling, and all visualizations
- `requirements.txt` - List of required dependencies for running the project

## Installation and Usage
To run the project, install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook hotel_booking_analysis.ipynb
```

## Goals and Approach
The primary objectives of this project are:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding patterns in hotel bookings.
2. **Statistical Analysis:** Identifying key factors influencing booking cancellations.
3. **Predictive Modeling:** Implementing machine learning models to predict cancellations.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle: [Hotel Booking Demand](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand).
